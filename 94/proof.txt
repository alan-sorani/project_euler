I translate the problem to that of Pythagorean triplets, and use their tree structure to get a straightforward generating series for the result.

[b] Step 1: Showing Parity of the Edges [/b]

Consider triangles with sides of lengths $a,a,b$, and assume that its area $A$ is integral. Passing a perpendicular through the side of length $b$ and to the vertex in front of it, we get a height of some length h. Using the Pythagorean theorem, $h^2 + \left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^2 = a^2$, so $h = \sqrt{a^2 - \left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^2}$. Then the area of the original triangle is
$A = \frac{h \cdot b}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{a^2 b^2 - \left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^2}}{2}$
so that after multiplying both sides by $16$ we have $16 A^2 = 4 a^2 b^2 - b^4$.
It follows that $b^2$ is even, so $b$ is also even. There is therefore $m \in \mathbb{N}_+$ such that $b = 2m$.

[b] Step 2: Translating the Problem to that of Primitive Pythagorean Triplets [/b]

In order to find possible values for $a,b$, we write $b = 2m$ for $m \in \mathbb{N}_+$ and see that the edge lengths of the half-triangle with the perpendicular edge as one of its sides are then of the form $(m, h, 2m \pm 1)$ or $(h, m, 2m \pm 1)$.

From such a triplet we can get $a,b$ by taking $a = 2m \pm 1$ and $b = 2m$.

[b] Step 3: Finding Primitive Pythagorean Triplets [/b]

It is shown in [url]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_primitive_Pythagorean_triples[/url] that all primitive Pythagorean triplets are generated by multiplying the following matrices $A,B,C$ from the left by the triplet $\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}$, and that multiplying such a matrix by a primitive Pythagorean triplet results in a primitive Pythagorean triplet.

- $A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & -2 & 2 \\ 2 & -1 & 2 \\ 2 & -2 & 3 \end{pmatrix}$
- $B = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 2 \\ 2 & 1 & 2 \\ 2 & 2 & 3 \end{pmatrix}$
- $C = \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 2 & 2 \\ -2 & 1 & 2 \\ -2 & 2 & 3 \end{pmatrix}$

We define the following.

- $U_1 = \left\{(m, h, 2m + 1) \middle\vert \substack{a,b,c \in \mathbb{Z} \\ m^2 + h^2 = (2m + 1)^2} \right\}$
- $U_2 = \left\{(h, m, 2m + 1) \middle\vert \substack{a,b,c \in \mathbb{Z} \\ m^2 + h^2 = (2m + 1)^2} \right\}$
- $L_1 = \left\{(m, h, 2m - 1) \middle\vert \substack{a,b,c \in \mathbb{Z} \\ m^2 + h^2 = (2m - 1)^2} \right\}$
- $L_2 = \left\{(h, m, 2m - 1) \middle\vert \substack{a,b,c \in \mathbb{Z} \\ m^2 + h^2 = (2m - 1)^2} \right\}$

We notice that $\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} \in L_1$. Direct computation gives $C u_1 \in L_2$ for all $u_1 \in U_1$, and $A l_2 \in U_1$ for all $l_2 \in L_2$. Hence, letting $v_0 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}$ we get infinitely-many primitive Pythagorean triplets $v_0, C v_0, AC v_0, CAC v_0, ACAC v_0, \ldots$

[b] Step 4: Showing Completeness [/b]

We can show directly by computation that another vertex of the Pythagorean triplet tree cannot by in none of $U_1, U_2, L_1, L_2$. Assuming towards a contradiction that there is such a vector $v$, we can take $v$ to be of minimal depth in the tree. Direct computation shows that $C L_1 = U_2$, $A U_2 = L_1$ (it shows inclusions, and computation for the inverse matrices shows the other inclusion). Similarly, $A L_2 = U_1$ and $C U_1 = L_2$.

We assume $v$ is in one of the sets. Depending on which set, we know that $A^{-1}v$ or $C^{-1}v$ isn't in the tree (i.e. it has non-positive coefficients). Direct computation rules the other options, which leads to contradiction.

[b] Conclusion [/b]

We calculate $v_0, C v_0, AC v_0, \ldots$ until the perimeter is too big. For each, we get the side lengths $a,b$ and add the perimeter of the triangle to the result.
