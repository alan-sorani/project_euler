- solve problem 6 for general powers using the faulhaber's theorem
- solve 83 using dijkstra's
- in combinatorics_utils, add an option for sum_of_k_naturals to set an upper bound for the summands
- solve 94 using Pell's equations
- Improve algorithm for factorizing all positive integers up to n. Just go over each prime, and for each, write its order of division for each of its multiples.
