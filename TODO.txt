- solve problem 6 for general powers using the faulhaber's theorem
- solve 83 using dijkstra's
- in combinatorics_utils, add an option for sum_of_k_naturals to set an upper bound for the summands
- solve 94 using Pell's equations
- skip powers that aren't relevant in exercise 47 (create a function for going over subsets of size 4)
